Envirocon (ground|work)
==========

The ground|work simulation is an online environment in which users grapple with maintaining the fragile peace in a post-conflict country (Nimpala). Over the course of seven weeks students use their knowledge of previous conflicts and conflict resolution strategies to complete both individual and team activities. These activities include drafting a conflict assessment, funding interventions, preventing or responding to humanitarian crises, and working with donors. When the simulation concludes, teams will find that Nimpala is in one of three states/conditions: peace, humanitarian crisis, or resurgence of conflict.
