HOW TO DEVELOP A GAME
---------------------
 A. Start the Django App
   1. ./manage.py startapp game_iamawesome #creates directory
   #decent example
   3. rm game_iamawesome/views.py #don't really need this
   4. GOTCHA: if you just made the directory, instead of running
	'startapp' then make sure there's an (empty) __init__.py
	in your ./myawesome_game directory

   #Where game-specific CSS, JS, and Images will go
   4. mkdir game_iamawesome/media
   5. ln -s ../game_iamawesome/media media/game_iamawesome

   #Where your game-specific HTML will go
   3. mkdir -p game_iamawesome/templates/game_iamawesome
   #decent example
   4. cp watchvideo_game/templates/watchvideo_game/video.html game_iamawesome/templates/game_iamawesome/

   5. add 'smart_sa.game_iamawesome' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings_shared.py
      make sure it's before 'smart_sa.game'
      NOTE: This is the one step that will actually BREAK your current app
            until you get models.py and the HTML in shape

   6. when you're ready:
      svn add game_iamawesome
      svn add media/game_iamawesome

 B. Edit models.py and customize pages(), template(), and variables()
    pages(): return a tuple with a string name for each page in the game
             GOTCHA: a tuple with a single string needs a comma like: ('my_page',)
    @arg page_id is the string of the current page in the pages() list.
    template(page_id): return a tuple of two elements:
             1. string for the template in your templates dir.  e.g. 'game_iamawesome/video.html'
             2. a dictionary or other object that will be exposed in the HTML templates as {{game_context}}
    variables(page_id): return a list of variables that the Javascript in the game will need to load and store
             NOTE: these variables MUST be complex objects--e.g. arrays or dictionaries in JS
                   so mostly you just need one, that stores the entire state.

 C. Create your game.  
    1. In JAVASCRIPT you can load and store your variables in the following way:

       var my_state = DjangoGame.getGameVar('game_iamawesome', {'default-object-here':'blah,blah'})
              the string from python's variables()-^^^^^^^      ^^^^ default if we're starting from scratch

       Then just keep the 'my_state' variable handy during the page 
       (e.g. make it a global variable, or attach it to your global game object)

       Whenever you want to change something, just...change it from the 'my_state' var,
       and when you want to save it, run:

       DjangoGame.saveState();

    2. In HTML.  
       * Your template should have {% extends "game/game.html" %} at the top
       * Put your make content in {% block game_content %}
       * Custom javascript and CSS in {% block game_js %} {% block game_css %}
             start the src path from '{{GAME_MEDIA}}game_iamawesome/' which starts in 
             your game's media/ path
       * The GamePage object (see game/models.py) is available from {{game}}
         The game_context object you passed from template() is available from {{game_context}}
