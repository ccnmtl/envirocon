<p>As a team please write a 2 or 3 page TRF document. This document should define your strategy and decisions on funding priorities, sequencing, and ideal results. Please define the key milestones that your investment will reach, rationale for priority action, and how these will help minimize the risk of a reversal into violent conflict and limit or reverse stabilization and recovery.</p>

<p>Please complete the following chart as well. The purpose of this chart is to relate your strategy to the minimum areas necessary for general recovery of a weak and failed state. This represents the basic framework for an effective TRM but includes clusters that were not part of the areas we analyze directly. Please consider how different actions/projects you have funded support the basic pillars--political, security, economic, and social.</p>

<p>This document should outline the indicators you critical to your strategy and how they are linked to the short, medium and long-term efforts.</p>

<p>The goals of the TRF are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place key actions, outputs and results for the main clusters and priorities in a simple calendar framework.</li>
<li>Clarify and manage expectations by increasing the practical implementation schedule and forcing prioritization.</li>
<li>Identify in advance periods of overlad and sectoral linkages.</li>
<li>Provide a basis for dialogue with donors on resource mobilization and allocation among sectors.</li>
</ul>

<p>This report is intended for the donors and for the national government. It is primarily a tool for harmonization of efforts and to foster dialogue between ministries and amongst donors. The donor conference will review this document while deciding the next round of funding allocations.</p>
